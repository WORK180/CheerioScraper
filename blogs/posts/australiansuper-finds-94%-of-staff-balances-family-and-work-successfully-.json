This is a 5% increase on last year and puts AustralianSuper 14% higher than average. This is certainly something worth celebrating.</p><p>Another reason to celebrate is that <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\">AustralianSuper </a><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\">has</a><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\"> been awarded WORK180&#x2019;s </a><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\">Flex Able</a><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\"> Certification</a> for the second year in a row. This certification is awarded to employers who demonstrate that they meet a set of criteria and that they truly walk the talk when it comes to flexible working. So, what is the secret behind AustralianSuper&#x2019;s success?</p><p>AustralianSuper has a guiding philosophy of &#x2018;members first&#x2019;. And this philosophy has been extended to all their employees as well. They know that when they look after their employees, their employees look after their business and their members. One of the ways that AustralianSuper demonstrates how much they value the person and not just their output, is to have embedded flexible working in everything that they do.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;Candidates talk about flexible working up front, during the interview process. This is not something that comes with tenure, but is just part of how things are done at AustralianSuper. The option of discussing flexible work is available to all employees, men and women, to allow everyone to flourish, at home and at work.&#x201D; says Resourcing Manager Jake Pickard.</em></p></blockquote><p>To enable this culture to remain strong, AustralianSuper have developed a range of two hour training sessions on topics such as unconscious bias, flexible working and diversity &amp; inclusion. They are focussed sessions with real world outcomes that do not impact too much on people&#x2019;s busy work days.</p><p>Because they have managed to create a strong team, people taking parental leave are sorely missed. Instead of taking a &#x201C;glass half empty&#x201D; approach, The HR team use this as a catalyst to work closely with the business leader to develop a flexible or part time role that enables the employee to get back to work as easily as possible in a mutually beneficial timeframe.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;AustralianSuper know how valuable their employees are. And they know that it is much better to enable flexible work arrangements, than it is to recruit again and again.&#x201D; Says Christina Smerdon, Chief Flex Enabler at WORK180.</em></p></blockquote><p>All these big and small actions taken by AustralianSuper over the last few years have culminated in some great improvements according to their employees who are now able to balance family and life more successfully. Congratulations AustralianSuper on achieving the Flex Able Certification for the second year in a row!&#xA0;</p><hr><h4 style=\"font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\"><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 16px;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/23b6dc58-1265-4f6f-bed4-35cb84280f9c.png\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/23b6dc58-1265-4f6f-bed4-35cb84280f9c.png\" style=\"float: right;\"></a></h4><h4><strong>About the Flex Able Certification</strong></h4><p>Flexible working is not just for mothers returning to work but for those with other caring commitments, health reasons, sporting interests, people looking for an alternative to retirement and those pursuing side projects.
