It is a worldwide industry whose practices can have widespread impact. Most of all, it is a powerful tool for progress and for development&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2013;&#xA0;Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary-General&#xA0;</p><p>Did you know today is the&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.un.org/sport/content/about-unosdp/international-day-sport-development-and-peace\" href=\"http://www.un.org/sport/content/about-unosdp/international-day-sport-development-and-peace\">International Day of Sport for Development and Peace?</a></p><p>The day is initiated by the UN to promote the potential of sport as a tool for social change.&#xA0; Over the last couple of months, Australia has seen a transformation for women in sport. Much has happened and to celebrate the advancement of women&#x2019;s sport, we&#x2019;d like to highlight some of the recent progressions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>AFL Women&#x2019;s</strong></p><p>In 2017, Australia was finally able to enjoy the first season of AFL Women&#x2019;s league- the national professional Australian rules football league for female players. The inauguration of the Women&#x2019;s League had been fast-tracked due to popular demand and aired its first game in February, with a turnout that was beyond the organisers&#x2019; expectations!</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/d2617ff1-aaed-4075-a1c2-349df3d9ab80.png\"></p><p><strong>Cricket Australia</strong></p><p>In March 2017, Cricket Australia agreed to increase the average salary for professional female cricket players by&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.cricket.com.au/news/cricket-australia-womens-pay-rise-double-salary-domestic-international-mou-aca-ca-sutherland/2017-03-21\" href=\"http://www.cricket.com.au/news/cricket-australia-womens-pay-rise-double-salary-domestic-international-mou-aca-ca-sutherland/2017-03-21\">125%</a>. As of July 2017, international women cricketers will have their salary increased from $79,000 to $179,000. State players will have their average salary more than doubled, from $22,000 to $52,000.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/aa2d75da-b12d-4762-8db6-7e5445ee1517.png\"></p><p>Media airtime</p><p>Although there is still a major gap to fill, women&#x2019;s sport has seen an increase of press coverage by mainstream media. Interestingly, airtime often translates to increased participation in the sport. Julie Tullburg, former sports journalist and now teacher in digital journalism concluded:</p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-28/media-still-failing-challenge-of-womens-sport-coverage/8150724\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-28/media-still-failing-challenge-of-womens-sport-coverage/8150724\">&quot;I know for a fact when I drove sports coverage for netball at the Sunday Herald Sun many years ago it really boosted participation&#x201D;.</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>More female role models in sport</strong></p><p>If you can see it, you can be it. According to&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/media-and-resources/media-releases/female-athletes-call-on-victoria-to-change-our-game\" href=\"https://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/media-and-resources/media-releases/female-athletes-call-on-victoria-to-change-our-game\">VicHealth&#x2019;s research</a>&#xA0;into community attitudes, nearly 75% of Victorians consider female role models an important motivator for women and girls to engage in sports and physical activity. The importance of role models should not be underestimated.&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-01/aaft-ygl012317.php\" href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-01/aaft-ygl012317.php\">New research</a>&#xA0;shows that gender bias and stereotypes take form and can impact career choices as early as at the age of 6. Pictures, stories and acknowledgement of successful female sports icons are important to break down barriers of who can and should engage in sports.
