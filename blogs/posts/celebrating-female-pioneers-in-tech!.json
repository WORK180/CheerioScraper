Born in 1815, she is considered to have written instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s and introduced many computer concepts making her the first computer programmer. However, it wasn&#x2019;t until the 1950s that her contributions to the field of computer science were truly acknowledged. In 1953 B.V. Bowden republished her notes in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines. Since then she has received numerous posthumous awards.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/387e5133-5f4b-4b36-8637-b5385d3a9530.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/387e5133-5f4b-4b36-8637-b5385d3a9530.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 10px; width: 400px; height: 400px;\"></p><p><strong>Grace Hopper</strong></p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper\">Grace Hopper</a>&#xA0;was a US Navy rear admiral, inventor and computer scientist. As a child, she loved disassembling alarm clocks and was always searching for the answer to understanding exactly how things worked &#x201C;inside&#x201D;. She went on to earn a doctorate in mathematics in 1934 from Yale and joined the Navy shortly thereafter to fight in World War II. She was instrumental in the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages after promoting the idea of machine-independent programming languages. She was also one of the first programmers of the&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I\">Harvard Mark I</a>&#xA0;computer and has received a number of nicknames over the years such as the &#x201C;Queen of Code&#x201D; &#x201C;amazing&#xA0;Grace&#x201D; and the &#x201C;mother of computing&#x201D;.

She completed a PhD in nuclear physics from MIT in the 70s, making her the first African-American to receive a doctorate from MIT. Her research has enabled the development of touch-tone telephones, call waiting,&#xA0;fibre&#xA0;optic cables, portable fax machines and the technology behind caller ID.</p><p>In 1999 Dr Jackson was appointed the 18th&#xA0;president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, established in 1824 it is the oldest technological research university in the US. In 2010 the board unanimously voted to extend her position for another ten years which she accepted.

Together with George&#xA0;Antheil&#xA0;they pioneered a way to manipulate radio frequencies and developed a radio guidance system for the Allied forces in World War II, allowing the allies to communicate secret messages during the war. The technology was not adopted until the 1960s by the US Navy but the principles are incorporated in modern Wi-Fi and essentially contributed to the wireless communications we use today.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#x200B;<img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/00cf00af-26e8-4a95-809d-80bc58fb710e.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/00cf00af-26e8-4a95-809d-80bc58fb710e.jpeg\" style=\"height: 317px; width: 600px;\"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ann Moffatt</strong><br><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://godigitalqld.dsiti.qld.gov.au/AnnMoffatt\" href=\"http://godigitalqld.dsiti.qld.gov.au/AnnMoffatt\">Ann Moffatt</a>&#xA0;started working the Information Technology Industry in 1959 as a programmer for Kodak.
