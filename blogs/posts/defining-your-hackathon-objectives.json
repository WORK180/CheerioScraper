There&#x2019;s a lot which can be achieved at a hackathon but the secret sauce to holding a successful hackathon is to clearly define your objectives. Here is what&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://hackathonsaustralia.com/\" href=\"http://hackathonsaustralia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hackathons Australia</a>&#xA0;did for&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://portal.govhack.org/locations/nsw/sydney.html\" href=\"http://portal.govhack.org/locations/nsw/sydney.html\" target=\"_blank\">GovHack Sydney</a>.</p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.govhack.org/\" href=\"http://www.govhack.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GovHack</a>&#xA0;is about encouraging and celebrating technical and creative capacity, connecting citizens with the government for great outcomes, and building upon the social and economic value of open data published by the government. Last year it was held at 31 locations in Australia with over 2200 participants. I&#x2019;ve been participating at GovHack for the past couple of years and this year, Hackathons Australia (aka myself and Liv, along with others) are fortunate enough to help run the local Sydney event.</p><p>After a great conversation with last year&apos;s organiser&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://au.linkedin.com/in/thaildhuynh\" href=\"https://au.linkedin.com/in/thaildhuynh\" target=\"_blank\">Thai</a>, we had our first team huddle at&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://fishburners.org/\" href=\"http://fishburners.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fishburners&#xA0;</a>where we used a design thinking to ask ourselves&#xA0;<strong>why&#xA0;</strong>we were holding GovHack Sydney. We wanted to empower our team and uncover what success meant for them (and us!). Here&#x2019;s our 5 step guide:</p><p><br></p><p>1.&#xA0;<strong>Firstly, we</strong>&#xA0;<strong>asked questions</strong>. How you want to see, think, feel and do after the hackathon? To create meaningful innovations, you need to empathise, know and understand how and why your team are here. After doing this exercise, we were able to identify each other&#x2019;s beliefs and values. Put these points on sticky notes on a wall.</p><p><br></p><p>2.&#xA0;<strong>Then we&#xA0;defined our &apos;why&apos;</strong>. Using your sticky notes, group them into the most common themes. Here is what GovHack Sydney&#x2019;s organising team came up with. We want to:</p><ol><li>Connect the community</li><li>Make a difference</li><li>Move useful solutions forward</li></ol><p>Doing this activity gave us clarity and focus. Our team&#x2019;s inspiration, motivation and decision making will stem from these themes.</p><p><br></p><p>3.<strong>&#xA0;Ideate.</strong>&#xA0;We spent 5 intensive minutes on each theme to think about what GovHack Sydney will look like in 2016. With a diverse mix of people from different industries, age groups, and abilities, the mix and collaboration enabled us to have rich conversations. Then&#xA0;we voted for our top 3 ideas and these became our core tasks (after event logistics).</p><p><br></p><p>4. Since we&#x2019;ve had a bit of background with organising events, we determined our&#xA0;<strong>SMART&#xA0;</strong>(specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timely)&#xA0;objectives. We listed the essentials of running a hackathon and inserted our core goals around the hackathon date: 29-31 July. Then we asked everyone to &#x2018;own&#x2019; a couple of tasks based on their strengths and outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Working in a group means everyone is open, trustworthy, transparent and willing to share experiences.<strong>&#xA0;Make the effort to&#xA0;get to know each other,</strong>&#xA0;their backgrounds, what their experiences are and work on each other&#x2019;s strengths.
