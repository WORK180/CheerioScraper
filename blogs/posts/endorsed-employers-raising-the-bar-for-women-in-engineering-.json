What can the industry do to encourage more women to join the profession? WORK180 &#xA0;Co-founder and CEO Valeria Ignatieva shares corporate insights of achievements to date. For example, AECOM has invested in closing the gender pay gap and in the space of 12 months, reduced the gap by 3.4 percent across its 2,750 Australian employees. <br></p><p>Valeria also points out that&#xA0;tackling the gender super gap is another priority for Endorsed Employers:&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;Engineering firms and other businesses </em><em>recognise</em><em> the structural impediments currently resulting in women retiring with&#xA0;an average of 47 </em><em>per cent</em><em> less in super compared to men. Schneider Electric&#xA0;along with&#xA0;BHP, Aurecon </em><em>and</em><em>&#xA0;Thales&#xA0;are some of the few engineering firms which pay superannuation whilst on unpaid parental leave. This is an extremely important initiative to make super fair.&#x201D; - Valeria Ignatieva, WORK180 Co-founder and CEO.&#xA0;</em></p></blockquote><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/rising-challenge-promising-data-shows-women-engineers-most-resilient-job-market\" href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/rising-challenge-promising-data-shows-women-engineers-most-resilient-job-market\">Read the full article here.&#xA0;</a></p><p><br></p><h3><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/how-quu-ceo-louise-dudley-normalising-women-utilities\" href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/how-quu-ceo-louise-dudley-normalising-women-utilities\">QUU CEO Louise Dudley is </a><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/how-quu-ceo-louise-dudley-normalising-women-utilities\" href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/how-quu-ceo-louise-dudley-normalising-women-utilities\">normalising</a><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/how-quu-ceo-louise-dudley-normalising-women-utilities\" href=\"https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/news/how-quu-ceo-louise-dudley-normalising-women-utilities\"> women in Utilities</a></h3><p>&#x201C;The fewer hurdles there are for women to progress their career, the more likely it is that we&#x2019;ll retain quality talent.
