By collecting and analysing data, employers know where their gender equality hotspots are and can take action to improve them.</em></p></blockquote><p>&#xA0;&#x201C;However, we cannot become complacent as there is still much work to do. All employers need to continue to ensure their employees are paid equitably. Do a pay gap analysis. Report the results to the executive and board. Pay gaps close when leaders see the numbers.</p><p>&#x201C;This improvement in the gender pay gap proves that actions speak louder than words. If every employer in Australia did a pay audit, analysed the results and then took action, we would eventually consign the national gender pay gap to the annals of history,&#x201D; she said.</p><p><strong>Causes of the Gender Pay Gap</strong></p><p>The gender pay gap is influenced by a number of factors, including:</p><ul><li>discrimination and bias in hiring and pay decisions</li><li>women and men working in different industries and different jobs, with female-dominated industries and jobs attracting lower wages</li><li>women&#x2019;s disproportionate share of unpaid caring and domestic work</li><li>lack of workplace flexibility to accommodate caring and other responsibilities, especially in senior roles</li><li>women&#x2019;s greater time out of the workforce impacting career progression and opportunities.</li></ul><p><strong>Employers Working on closing the Gender Pay Gap</strong></p><p>Pay Equity is a priority for WORK180 and a key feature of our pre-screening criteria.
