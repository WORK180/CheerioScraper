On this quest, we have connected with leaders aligned to our mission of progressing gender equality through using the power of the female economy. Our community is rich with exceptional female leaders from a range of cultural and social backgrounds, and who represent many industries. We are delighted to showcase our community in our first ebook:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://online.fliphtml5.com/bzrz/ygho/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Female Leader Conversations.</em></a></p>\n\n<h4>DIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU CAN SEE IT, YOU CAN BE IT.</h4>\n\n<p>Femeconomy has a role in promoting tales of leadership across industries. To give women and companies ideas on how they can open doors for other women to proceed to the ranks of Board Director, CEO and successful business owner. This book is a representation of our diverse community.</p>\n\n<p>Natasha Exelby has experienced war. Maree McPherson helps our regional sisters shatter grass ceilings. Sharon Kinchela and Chris Figg are advancing our collective understanding of Australia&#x2019;s rich Aboriginal heritage. Div Pillay is helping women from culturally diverse backgrounds to progress. Anna Mitsios and Kristy Chong are disrupting retail by creating a more sustainable world that is better for our collective health. Trina Hockley and Annette Kimmitt champion women, supporting other women to leadership. Lutfiye Tahseen shares how and why&#xA0;she completed three degrees whilst having children. Sheena Ireland gives us important insights on how to work with Government. Deanna Varga provides practical advice on how to gain a Board Directorship position.</p>\n\n<h4>IN 2016, WOMEN REPRESENTED ONLY 21% OF QUOTED MEDIA SOURCES, SO THE STORIES OF AUSTRALIAN FEMALE LEADERS GO LARGELY UNTOLD.</h4>\n\n<p>Our female leader interviews are a way for us to remedy this imbalance. Stories of female leaders, who typically pursue non-traditional, non-linear career paths are fascinating. We want to know in their words how they&#x2019;ve reached the pinnacles of leadership.<br>\nThese trailblazing female leaders&#x2019; stories, wisdom and friendship have left an indelible imprint on us, as they will on you.
