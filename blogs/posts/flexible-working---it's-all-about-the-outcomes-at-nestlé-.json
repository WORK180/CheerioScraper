Nestl&#xE9; is committed to empowering their people through flexible work practices. They know priorities can blend and blur on any given day, which is why they trust their people to make choices about when and where they get their job done, so that they can better balance their work and personal commitments.</p><p>And it&#x2019;s all about two simple questions that employees ask themselves to decide whether to work flexibly:</p><p>1. Will I be able to get my job done?<br>2. Will my choice negatively affect others?</p><p>Nestl&#xE9; Oceania Director Human Resources, Biplab Baksi says, &#x201C;We call this <em>How We Work</em>. Our people have embraced it and we&#x2019;ve all witnessed the benefits it has created.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve learnt new, novel ways of working, enabled by technology, which has in turn encouraged further innovation. We&#x2019;ve also strengthened our communications with colleagues as well as built new connections. Above all, our renewed focus has been a revelation. Our people have increased efficiency in both their work and personal lives, and this is leading to better results for everyone.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote><p>Across the company, the clear focus is on outcomes, not when or where work is being done.
