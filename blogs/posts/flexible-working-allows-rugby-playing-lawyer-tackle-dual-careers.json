This enables Mr Carbone to leave early two days a week to attend rugby training.</p><p>He also took a break from law to expand his sporting career overseas, recently returning from an eight-month stint playing for Lyons Piacenza in Italy. The firm supported this move and made sure he had a definite role to come back to.&#xA0;</p><p>Mr Carbone may have taken his lead from CBP&#x2019;s managing partner Dunstan de Souza and deputy managing partner Nick Crennan. Both set an example by working flexible hours, although they do not have formal arrangements.&#xA0;</p><p>The firm has also been recognised by DCC Jobs, a social enterprise that helps women find jobs in companies that rank well on factors such as gender diversity, flexible working and empowerment.</p><p><strong>CBP is the first and only law firm to have received a <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/advertisers/flex-able-certification\">Flex Able certification</a> from DCC. </strong>According to the firm&#x2019;s profile on the DCC website, 26 per cent of lawyers at CBP have flexible working arrangements.</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;CBP have set the bar pretty high with flexible work arrangements that are genuinely embedded in their culture &#x2013; it is just the way they do things nowadays,&#x201D; said Christina Smerdon, chief flex enabler at DCC.</p></blockquote><p>&#x201C;There is no confusion for new recruits who know that they can talk about making their role flexible upfront during the interview process. &#xA0;</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;For CBP, becoming Australia&#x2019;s first law firm to achieve the Flex Able certification was a natural next step to showcase their amazing workplace and that you can have a life and a family and a great career in law without sacrificing yourself along the way.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p>Learn more about work/life balance at CBP <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/colin-biggers-and-paisley\" href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/colin-biggers-and-paisley\">here</a>.</p><p><small>This article was originally published by</small><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/careers/21499-flexible-working-lets-rugby-playing-lawyer-tackle-dual-careers\" href=\"https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/careers/21499-flexible-working-lets-rugby-playing-lawyer-tackle-dual-careers\"><small> Lawyer&apos;s Weekly.</small></a><br></p><small></small>&#x200B;<p><strong>About the Flex Able Certification</strong></p><p><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/23b6dc58-1265-4f6f-bed4-35cb84280f9c.png\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/23b6dc58-1265-4f6f-bed4-35cb84280f9c.png\" style=\"float: right;\"></p><p>Flexible working is not just for mothers returning to work but for those with other caring commitments, health reasons, sporting interests, people looking for an alternative to retirement and those pursuing side projects. Companies with the most engaged workforces offer flexibility and are focused on creating an inclusive culture where the reason for needing flexibility does not matter.&#xA0;</p><p>But how can you tell which employer is truly walking the talk when it comes to offering flexible work?
