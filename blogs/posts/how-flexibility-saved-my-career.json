I&#x2019;ve been lucky to have worked flexibly in different ways for nearly 8 years before co-founding DCC Jobs in 2015 to help women like me. DCC is a unique job site, where employers are pre-screened to ensure they support women&#x2019;s careers before they can advertise jobs.</p><p>I know first-hand how difficult it is to find a suitable job, go through the application process, bring up flexibility only to be told it&apos;s not available. Or worse, starting in a role where the company has made it sound like it&#x2019;s flexible, only to find out that everyone is chained to the desk in a culture of presenteeism. Sadly, this is a problem that&#x2019;s still prevalent and almost daily we hear similar stories from women in our community.</p><p>Did you know that in Australia, less than 50 per cent of the non-public sector offers flexible working options? Finding out who the supportive employers are is the difficult part, and exactly the challenge we&#x2019;re solving at DCC.</p><p>We&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.diversecitycareers.com/bestemployers\" href=\"https://www.diversecitycareers.com/bestemployers\" target=\"_blank\">display information</a>&#xA0;around what employers offer in terms of paid parental leave, pay equity, flexible working arrangements, employee engagement scores plus much more. This information is not publicly listed elsewhere and forms a valuable tool for women to assess their next employer. DCC reject around 10% of companies who apply to advertise with us, and we&#x2019;ve seen incredible changes made internally in the last two years by companies who return and pass the criteria to advertise.</p><p>But the work doesn&#x2019;t stop here. Lots of organisations still have a way to go, and it&#x2019;s all about raising awareness and sharing stories of other&#x2019;s success.
