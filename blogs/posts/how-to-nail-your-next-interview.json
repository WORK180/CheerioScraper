My preparation varied and so did my results.</p>\n\n<p>The interviews where I really showed up and had the most success were the ones where I nailed my mindset and self-belief that I was the right person for the role in preparation for the interview. I also felt the most inspired and comfortable in my own skin. I felt proud to be presenting my experience, strengths and skills for consideration and left the room knowing I had done my best.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I&#x2019;ve also attended interviews where I didn&#x2019;t truly believe I was the right person for the role or I didn&#x2019;t know if I really wanted the role. Not surprisingly, I wasn&#x2019;t offered these roles. Further proof that the right mindset and preparation is key.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t truly believe you are the right person for the role, chances are the people interviewing you and making recruitment decisions won&#x2019;t either.</p>\n\n<p>Convincing yourself that you are the best person for the job is the first step in creating the right mindset for your next job interview.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most important things you can take with you into a job interview are rock solid self-belief, confidence and the right mindset.</p>\n\n<p>Confidence is a skill that can be learnt, practiced and mastered. It&#x2019;s also a state of mind underpinned by self-belief.</p>\n\n<p>Confidence can also be swallowed up by fear and doubts if you give them too much head space.</p>\n\n<p>Confidence is best fuelled by self-belief.</p>\n\n<p>Here are 3 ways you can increase your self-belief and confidence for your next job interview:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Write a list of all the reasons why you are the right person for the role you are applying for. Make sure you address the criteria that is important to the organisation first. The most compelling reasons will be examples of when and how you have demonstrated a skill the employer is looking for. (Don&#x2019;t take this list to the interview with you. Keep it in the back of your mind and work these statements into the interview conversation.)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>When creating this list of reasons why you are the right person for the role, also notice any doubts and fears that may be showing up in your thoughts about these statements. Write these negative thoughts down on a separate list and burn them. You definitely don&#x2019;t want to take these into the job interview with you. Doubts and fears are normal and should be acknowledged. When we give them power they can sabotage what we want to achieve though.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Practice. Ask a friend, family member or colleague to help you practice for your job interview. Give them some questions to ask you, so you can practice saying your statements and reasons aloud in a conversational way.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>When you really show up as yourself, equipped with rock solid self-belief, confidence and conviction that you are the right person for the role, you are giving yourself the best chance of success.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#x2019;t need luck when your mindset is fuelled by confidence and self-belief.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Kim&#xA0;is one of our contributors, read about them all <a href=\"/contributors\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"color:#A97FB1\"><strong>About DCC Jobs</strong></span></h5>\n\n<p>DCC Jobs is a <a href=\"/job-search\">jobs board </a>with a difference!
