With urban toll road networks in Australia and North America, they&#x2019;re committed to strengthening communities through transport by providing smarter, faster and safer ways for people to travel.</p>\n\n<p>They&#x2019;re also committed to embedding a fully flexible work culture for their employees.</p>\n\n<p>It&#x2019;s one of the things that sets them apart &#x2013; their focus on flexible work practices has always been strong. As early adopters, they&#x2019;ve implemented organisational-wide training and educational programs to communicate what flexible working looks like at Transurban and partnered with technology teams to enable more agile ways of working. Strong leadership and active role modelling &#x2013; at all levels within the organisation &#x2013; has also meant that employees feel fully supported to embrace the organisation&#x2019;s flexible work offerings.</p>\n\n<p>And now, they&#x2019;re celebrating a proud moment. Transurban has been announced as a Flex Able Certified employee and are the proud recipients of the WORK180 Flex Able Certification.</p>\n\n<p>This certification is a testament to the way in which Transurban continues to work and is formal recognition that flexible working has become a normal part of strategic and everyday working.</p>\n\n<p>They know it&#x2019;s important to get the balance right between professional and personal commitments. As a business, they provide and promote a range of flexible work practices and offer support tools that meet their people&#x2019;s needs through each phase of their life and career, ensuring they&#x2019;re set up for success in achieving business objectives.</p>\n\n<p>They&#x2019;re now eager to translate their insights from their flexible working approach to ensure it supports all aspects of a diverse, inclusive and connected workplace.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations, Transurban!</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h4 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(169, 126, 179); margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">About the Flex Able Certification</strong></h4>\n\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 1.6rem; font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent; color: rgb(238, 76, 155); text-decoration-line: none; transition: all 0.3s ease 0s;\"><img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/23b6dc58-1265-4f6f-bed4-35cb84280f9c.png\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; float: right;\"></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 1.6rem; font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\">Flexible working is not just for mothers returning to work but for those with other caring commitments, health reasons, sporting interests, people looking for an alternative to retirement and those pursuing side projects.
