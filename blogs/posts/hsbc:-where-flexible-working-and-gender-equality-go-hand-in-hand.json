Their first goal was to mainstream flexible work.&#xA0;</em></p></blockquote><p>In order to achieve this, the bank rolled out training for their managers, upgraded their technology to allow the vast majority of employees to work remotely, and created and disseminated a variety of toolkits to enable their managers and employees to work through the finer details, with a HR team at the ready should anyone need guidance.</p><p>When asked,<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/hsbc\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/hsbc\"> HSBC </a>employees historically believed that flexible working was merely working from home. Whilst this is one form of flexible working, there are so many others such as working part time, changing your start and finish times for any reason as all &#x2013; such as having a surf before work, or making use of an informal compressed work week to allow staff to meet their objectives, while fulfilling their potential and maintaining a healthy work and life balance.</p><p>One of the ways the bank worked to expand the range of flexible work options is through sharing the stories of how people are doing it, and why it works for them.</p><blockquote><p><em>Far from being a secret that you took two hours out of the day to go to a yoga class, it is celebrated and assumed that you will get your work done regardless.</em></p></blockquote><p>HSBC hires adults and then trusts them to get their work done.</p><p>If you<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.work180.com.au/blog/2018/04/3-baby-steps-to-create-a-great-workplace-for-yourself?\" href=\"http://www.work180.com.au/blog/2018/04/3-baby-steps-to-create-a-great-workplace-for-yourself?\"> have done your vision board,</a> know your worth at work and are ready to find a company where you can have your dream career with a pathway to leadership AND have the flexibility you need, then HSBC could be the right company for you to investigate further.</p><p>Congratulations HSBC on becoming Flex Able Certified.</p><hr><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/advertisers/flex-able-certification\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 16px;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/23b6dc58-1265-4f6f-bed4-35cb84280f9c.png\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/23b6dc58-1265-4f6f-bed4-35cb84280f9c.png\" style=\"float: right;\"></a></p><h4 style=\"font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\"><strong>About the Flex Able Certification</strong></h4><p>Flexible working is not just for mothers returning to work but for those with other caring commitments, health reasons, sporting interests, people looking for an alternative to retirement and those pursuing side projects.
