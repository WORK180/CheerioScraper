You have to have a&#xA0;CEIO&#xA0;who is very committed because if the CEO is not&#xA0;supportive&#xA0;it&#x2019;s very difficult to get any traction,&#x201D; added Dooley.</p>\n\n<p>&#x201C;Our CEO David Attenborough is a very visible leader of the diversity and inclusion effort of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\">Tabcorp</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x201C;For&#xA0;us&#xA0;it has really been about a range of initiatives, including long-term sourcing of women into key operational roles, mentoring programs, leading practice policies around flexible working and parental leave arrangements that benefit both men and women.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\">Tabcorp</a>&apos;s key diversity achievements include:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In the 2017 WGEA Employer of Choice for Gender&#xA0;Equality&#xA0;application females represented 39&#xA0;per cent&#xA0;of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\">Tabcorp</a>&#x2019;s senior leader roles</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Strong commitment to equal pay with a gender pay gap for like-for-like roles of only 1.2% (compared to an average of approximately 23.1% for other major Australian companies)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\">Tabcorp</a>&#xA0;is the only employer in the gambling industry to receive the 2017 Employer of Choice for Gender Equality citation from the WGEA and has held this citation for the last three years</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Parental leave entitlements include<a href=\"http://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\"> payment of superannuation on all paid parental leave, 13 weeks paid leave for primary&#xA0;</a><a href=\"http://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\">carergivers</a><a href=\"http://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\">&#xA0;and a market-leading six weeks paid leave for secondary caregivers</a>&#xA0;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/tabcorp\">Tabcorp</a>&#xA0;established a Women&#x2019;s Mentoring Program in 2012 and last year extended it to support its racing industry partners.
