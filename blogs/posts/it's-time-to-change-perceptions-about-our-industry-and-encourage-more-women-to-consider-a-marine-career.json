Ron talks about the job,<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/blog/2018/06/port-of-brisbane-launches-marine-cadetship-program-for-women\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/blog/2018/06/port-of-brisbane-launches-marine-cadetship-program-for-women\"> the new cadetship program</a> launched by Port of Brisbane and explains what it&apos;s all about.&#xA0;</p><p>With a background in the diving industry, Ron Whitney has been with Port of Brisbane for 11 years. As Marine Operations Coordinator, he will look after our Cadets and the wider teams that run many of our vessels. We grabbed 20 minutes with Ron to get his thoughts on the challenge and the opportunity ahead of you as a Port of Brisbane Cadet.&#xA0;</p><h4><strong>WHY DO YOU DO THIS JOB, RON?</strong></h4><p>It starts with the great team I get to work with and the diversity of the role. It really does change every day. But it&#x2019;s also hard to see past the beauty of where we work. The people in my teams spend 90% of their time out on the water, usually on the Brisbane River or in Moreton Bay. While it&#x2019;s clearly not the main reason why you should take on this job, you get to see some pretty nice sights, including dolphins and whales at times.<br><br></p><h4><strong>DESCRIBE A TYPICAL DAY AS A CADET AT PORT OF BRISBANE.&#xA0;<img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/2376ccb7-c395-488d-9021-848af2e737a7.jpeg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/2376ccb7-c395-488d-9021-848af2e737a7.jpeg\"></strong></h4><p>Our Cadets will be employed as Deckhands working within&#xA0;our marine team.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s hard to describe &#x2018;a day in the life&#x2019; because in this job every day really is different. You&#x2019;ll arrive at 7am and will be allocated to a vessel or a job. You could spend your morning working on a vessel levelling Moreton Bay or cleaning up a mooring buoy for re-instalment. Then you might head out on a survey vessel.<br>&#xA0;<br>On different days, you might get involved in engine room rounds while the vessel&#x2019;s working; or you could be working on deck doing vessel cleaning and maintenance. You&#x2019;ll be working with important marine operation equipment and survey technology so there&#x2019;s also a lot of careful preparation and planning, going through risk assessments and standard operating procedures.<br>&#xA0;</p><h4><strong>WHY ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THE CADETSHIP PROGRAM?<img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/42164235-c118-46cb-b515-93f45dbdf759.jpeg\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/42164235-c118-46cb-b515-93f45dbdf759.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 10px; float: right;\"></strong></h4><p>I can&#x2019;t wait to get started with the Program because we really want to encourage more women to learn about and develop skills in our industry. We&#x2019;re currently missing out on half the workforce and I think this has a lot to do with perceptions about our industry. It&#x2019;s time to change that. While it is a hands-on role, it&#x2019;s not the &#x2018;heavy lifting&#x2019; job people might imagine it to be. We want to teach Cadets to operate machinery and deploy the tools safely and effectively. We also want different perspectives across the team, to help us keep improving and to drive open conversations.<br>&#xA0;<br>I think it&#x2019;s a great opportunity for people who want to develop practical skills and build a new career, whilst also getting job variety and benefitting from family friendly hours. We&#x2019;re really keen to ensure that our Cadets progress through the organisation. PBPL is very diverse &#x2013; we have engineering, hydrographic surveying, property and, of course, business functions. So there are lots of opportunities to diversify.<br>&#xA0;</p><h4><strong>ANY ADVICE FOR POTENTIAL CADETS OUT THERE?&#xA0;<img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/39d260e4-d8cc-46c8-ad7a-c2f6c5db6caa.jpeg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/39d260e4-d8cc-46c8-ad7a-c2f6c5db6caa.jpeg\"></strong></h4><p>My friends who love the water say &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe you get paid to do this&#x201D; and I do feel lucky to enjoy what I do. Although the Brisbane weather is usually great it&#x2019;s important to remember that we operate in all conditions, as long as it&#x2019;s safe.<br>&#xA0;<br>We also roll up our sleeves and get involved and it can be dirty work. Preparing, cleaning and maintaining our equipment can mean plenty of mud and oil. But that work is the backbone of this operation and is critical to a well-run business. We&#x2019;ve got a great bunch of people here who are very welcoming and who are proud of the work we do. We&#x2019;re looking for Cadets who are eager to learn and get involved. We&#x2019;ll provide the support and a team of people who are ready to share their knowledge and expertise.<br></p><hr><h4><strong>INTERESTED IN JOINING RON AND THE PORT OF BRISBANE TEAM?
