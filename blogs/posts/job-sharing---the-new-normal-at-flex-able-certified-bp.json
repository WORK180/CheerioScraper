Flexible working has been embedded within BP for many years and they are now tweaking their processes for excellence rather than starting from scratch.</p><p>For example, Lisa and Lorinda have been job sharing at <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/bp\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/bp\">BP</a> for 10 years. In that time have both experienced both life balance and career progression. They speak about their experience in this clip at 2.25 mins:&#xA0;</p><div><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARN5RptRHy4\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div><p><br></p><blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;Between the two of us we&#x2019;ve worked here for 48 years, 25 for me and 23 for Lorinda and 10 of those we&#x2019;ve been job-sharing,&#x201D;</em> says Lisa.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;We both work 3 days a week so we have one overlap day in the middle and we get time to manage our work-life balance&#x201D; </em>added Lorinda</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;BP has really adapted and changed and embraced flexibility and agile working.&#xA0; All of those things make it a great place to work and big reasons for why I am still here after so long&#x201D; </em>- Lorinda&#xA0;</p></blockquote><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/bp\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/bp\">BP</a> wants to attract and retain the very best people in their business and once these people join the company, they want to ensure that they are respected and cared for.</p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/bp\" href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/bp\">BP</a> wants their people to have every opportunity to continue with BP and have great lives and careers there. This set of beliefs and values is what continues to drive BP towards embedding and supporting working with flexibility.</p><p>To continue the embedding of flexible working, the recruitment team have conversations with hiring managers about how each job can be done flexibly.&#xA0; This process requires hiring managers to think outside the square before the recruitment process begins.</p><blockquote><p><em>Flexible working is therefore not an afterthought, but it is built into the entire process.</em></p></blockquote><p>When BP advertises a job with flexible work arrangements, it is because those arrangements genuinely exist for the role. &#xA0;For successful candidates, there is the opportunity to discuss flexible working during the interview process.</p><p>Congratulations BP on continuing to build on a strong foundation of enabling your people to do their best at work and outside of work!</p><hr><h4><strong>About BP<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/bp\" href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/clients/bp\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/736b00f0-00a5-4f77-9f72-f5473de00a2a.png\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/736b00f0-00a5-4f77-9f72-f5473de00a2a.png\" style=\"float:right\"></a></strong></h4><p>Join Endorsed Employer for Women BP!
