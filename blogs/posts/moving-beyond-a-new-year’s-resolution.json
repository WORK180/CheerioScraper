Everything from the usual &apos;lose weight&apos; and &apos;go to the gym&apos; to &apos;start writing my novel&apos;. I knew only too well that these goals were ones I had been carrying now for a few years, yet never really managed to get progress them far or tended to focus on them for a short spurt of time then they were shelved as I made excuses like &#x2018;life got in the way&#x2019;.&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;<br>It sounds cheesy but I did feel like stars aligned and during July, RMS was proud to co-host &#x2018;The Power of 8&#x2019; with WORK180 in Sydney. During the event J&#xE9;romine Alpe, founder of the Power of 8 gave us some techniques to help us find happiness and peak performance not only in our careers, but all elements of our life.&#xA0;<br>&#x200B;<br></p><div><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/281371550\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><br>Some key take away messages from Jeromine&#x2019;s presentation were to:</p><p>Identify who and what is most important to you &#x2013; the 8 pillars we thought of and discussed in small groups were:</p><h4>1.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Career and purpose<br>2.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Financial Freedom<br>3.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Personal growth<br>4.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Health and Wellbeing<br>5.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Mindfulness<br>6.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Energy and Focus<br>7.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Positive Relationships<br>8.&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Female Leadership and Impact&#xA0;</h4><p>Think about what you need to focus on in order to move forward in the areas that matter most &#x2013; I decided that my new years&apos; resolutions needed to become more concrete so Health and Well-being became my top priority.</p><p>Focus only on three areas and set a 90 day action plan to invest on your own personal growth &#x2013; my other areas of focus were on mindfulness and financial freedom.</p><p>I am pleased to say that I am already back into regular exercise (minimum of three 30 minute sessions a week), I meditate daily and I have sought advice from a financial advisor to get my budget in order.<br>&#xA0;<br>Our Executive Director, Compliance &amp; Regulatory Services, Melinda Bailey also spoke at the event. She shared her experience as a woman who has carved a career path in traditionally male-dominated workforces.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#xA0; <img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://d418bv7mr3wfv.cloudfront.net/s3/W1siZiIsIjIwMTgvMDkvMTQvMDUvNTUvMTMvNTkwL3ZsY3NuYXAtMjAxOC0wOC0wMi0xMWgzM20zMnMzNDUucG5nIl1d\" src=\"https://d418bv7mr3wfv.cloudfront.net/s3/W1siZiIsIjIwMTgvMDkvMTQvMDUvNTUvMTMvNTkwL3ZsY3NuYXAtMjAxOC0wOC0wMi0xMWgzM20zMnMzNDUucG5nIl1d\" style=\"margin: 10px; width: 650px; height: 366px;\"></p><p><br>I enjoyed hearing her authentic and genuine reflection of her career journey. She said as women, we often feel pressure to act like &#x2018;one of the boys&#x2019; to be successful. Instead, she encouraged us to seek purposeful careers, back ourselves and other female colleagues, own our decisions, connect with strong mentors, and be patient &#x2013; because careers are marathons, not sprints, and the next opportunity will come.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://d418bv7mr3wfv.cloudfront.net/s3/W1siZiIsIjIwMTgvMDkvMTQvMDUvNTMvMzgvOTYyL3ZsY3NuYXAtMjAxOC0wOC0wMi0xMWgzNW0xNHM2OTMucG5nIl1d\" src=\"https://d418bv7mr3wfv.cloudfront.net/s3/W1siZiIsIjIwMTgvMDkvMTQvMDUvNTMvMzgvOTYyL3ZsY3NuYXAtMjAxOC0wOC0wMi0xMWgzNW0xNHM2OTMucG5nIl1d\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 10px; width: 650px; height: 366px;\"><br>&#xA0;<br></p><p>We received some positive feedback from those who attended who enjoyed hearing from Melinda and J&#xE9;romine and networking with other professionals.
