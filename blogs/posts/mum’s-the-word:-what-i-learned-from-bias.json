We all use stereotypes, every day, without consciously even realising it.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<blockquote>From very early on, we learn the undertone of our culture&apos;s messages. &#xA0;Margo Monteith, a professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky, has stated that children form definite and entrenched stereotypes of social groups by the age of five. &#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199805/where-bias-begins-the-truth-about-stereotypes\">By the age of five!</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>My friend ended up having a courageous conversation with the school Principal. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t about political correctness.&#xA0;It was simply about raising awareness and asking the school to develop a more mindful approach to school events in order to address the impact of unconscious bias with the primary school students.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, Australians love and value their mums. So why tell this story?&#xA0;I know stories start conversations.&#xA0;Conversations invite awareness and questioning.&#xA0;As we buy products and services for Mother&#x2019;s Day, I hope this story can begin courageous conversations between people to ask &#x201C;which biases are ours&#x201D;?&#xA0;And &quot;how can we do something about it&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"color:#A97FB1\"><strong>About DCC Jobs</strong></span></h5>\n\n<p>DCC Jobs is a <a href=\"/job-search\">jobs board </a>with a difference!
