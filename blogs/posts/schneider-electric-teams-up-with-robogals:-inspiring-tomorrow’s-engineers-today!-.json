By making STEM activities outside of school fun and interesting, it engages children to do more than simply learn, by demonstrating the real-life possibilities STEM provides.</p><p><strong>Collaborating with ROBOGALS</strong></p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://robogals.org/\" href=\"https://robogals.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Robogals</a>&#xA0;is a student-run organisation that aims to increase female participation in engineering, science and technology through fun and educational initiatives aimed at girls in primary and secondary school. Teaming up with Robogals, Schneider Electric&#xA0;recently ran two workshops in their Melbourne office for Schneider&#x2019;s Employees and Customers children aged 11-15 years. &#xA0;The workshops were designed to engage students in a range of engineering topics in a way that is fun and creative.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Endorsed Employer for Women Schneider Electric and Rabogals\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/c6e1da96-72cd-4a78-8be5-aa252236f5d8.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/c6e1da96-72cd-4a78-8be5-aa252236f5d8.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 10px;\"></p><p>Working in pairs, the children constructed and programmed Lego NXT Mindstorm kits.&#xA0; This kit included a central CPU brick that is programmed using a simple, visual interface to use components such as light sensors, colour sensors, sound sensors, motors, sound outputs and more. &#x201C;Our goal is to spark a passion for these children to pursue a career in STEM by providing a hands-on lesson. The children had a lot of fun as did the younger sisters, brothers, mums and dads who were eagerly spectating, no doubt keen to get involved themselves!&#x201D; Jenny Jagic, HR Business Partner Vic/TAS at Schneider Electric.<br><br></p><p>Schneider Electric is a DCC Endorsed Employer for Women.
