How can you up your resume&#x2019;s chances of surviving the first brutal cull?</p><p>First up let&#x2019;s assume you&#x2019;ve done your background research and compiled all your heavily quantified experience to match the job description. This means your resume:</p><ul><li>has a strong storyline laced with loads of transferable, adaptive and&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.monster.co.uk/career-advice/article/what-skills-should-i-include-on-my-cv\" href=\"https://www.monster.co.uk/career-advice/article/what-skills-should-i-include-on-my-cv\" target=\"_blank\">job specific skills&#xA0;</a>and lots of relevant and specific experience<br><br></li><li>is packing sufficient&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.livecareer.com/quintessential/identifying-resume-keywords\" href=\"https://www.livecareer.com/quintessential/identifying-resume-keywords\" target=\"_blank\">&#x2018;key word&#x2019;&#xA0;</a>power to pass any initial &#x2018;bot scan&#x2019;</li></ul><p>Now it has six seconds to impress a hiring human or find itself face down in the reject pile.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Picture this &#x2013; layout matters</strong></p><p>The Internet has changed the way we read. Odds on most recruiting brains are wired to respond to images, colour and columns as they peruse piles of resumes.</p><p>In short, your resume could struggle in the six-second stakes if it&#x2019;s a solely black and while, linear, left to right read document of more than three pages.</p><p>That said; format your resume to fit your target industry. For example, resumes for&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://creativemarket.com/blog/7-tips-for-designing-the-perfect-resume\" href=\"https://creativemarket.com/blog/7-tips-for-designing-the-perfect-resume\" target=\"_blank\">designers and graphic artists&#xA0;</a>are likely to be more visually spectacular than resumes for&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-this-is-an-excellent-resume-2013-11\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-this-is-an-excellent-resume-2013-11\" target=\"_blank\">business administrators and accountants</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Costume dramas &#x2013; working out what to wear</strong></p><p>There are oodles of online sites telling you how to dress for interview success by&#x2018;looking professional&#x2019;.&#xA0; Working out what this means for you and for a particular role with a specific employer can be tricky. Certainly, you need to look &#x2019;right &#x2018; for the job but you also need to look like a confident, comfortable version of you.</p><p><strong>Here&#x2019;s what I suggest:</strong></p><p>Crack the code - dress for combat.</p><p>Make sure your forensic trawl of any target company&#x2019;s social media includes the dress code. Naturally, this will vary wildly across industries and mildly across your potential new colleagues.</p><p>Once you&#x2019;ve sussed your prospective employers &#x2018;look and feel&#x2019;, think of your interview clothes as the best kind of battle dress. This means they need to be:</p><ul><li>Protective &#x2013; you feel safe and comfortable in your skin</li><li>Practical &#x2013; they fit you well and allow you to move freely&#xA0;</li><li>Powerful &#x2013; you feel capable, confident, a tiny bit awe inspiring</li></ul><p>Last but not least, like all combat dress, your interview clothes should look professional. They tell the panel that you belong and that you&#x2019;re fully kitted out and ready to get to work.</p><p>Run your interview costume though through its battle dress paces. If you&#x2019;re still not totally sure I suggest you &#x2019;err on the side of smart&#x2019;.</p><p><strong>Premiere performance - acting the part</strong></p><p><img alt=\"fake-it\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5731394ec2ea515cf2c254d8/t/589bef66197aea56d58d7877/1486614410438/fake-it\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5731394ec2ea515cf2c254d8/t/589bef66197aea56d58d7877/1486614410438/fake-it\" style=\"float:right; width:333px\"></p><p>At the interview, adopt a nerve shattering &#x2018;fake it til you make it&#x2019; front. &#x2018;Acting the part&#x2019; can quell your performance anxiety and buy you breathing time while you ease yourself into the star role of perfect candidate for the job.</p><p>Take heart from knowing your resume has aced Act 1 - the ruthless cull. Its beautifully presented, cleverly connected content has put you centre stage in Act 2 &#x2013; the winning interview.</p><p>Conveying confidence you genuinely merit but may not feel takes discipline, and practice, and begins with your body.&#xA0; Before the interview, try striking a&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\" target=\"_blank\">power pose</a>, slowing your breathing, and relaxing your shoulders. In the room, make eye contact, smile, and still any fidgety limbs.</p><p>Get your physical self &#x2018;onside&#x2019;.
