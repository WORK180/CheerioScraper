But the one thing that&#x2019;s always been consistent is my passion for cycling.</p>\n\n<p>Today I am an IT Asset and Configuration Manager, and I was one of the original IT crew to move to the new Macquarie Park campus from our North Sydney office in 2007. In fact, I was the first person to start at our on-site gym!</p>\n\n<h4><strong>My cycling journey</strong>&#xA0;</h4>\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ve pretty much cycled my whole life, I&#x2019;m a kiwi. My riding really changed after participating in my first Tour de Cure in 2011 (a national cycling event to fundraise money for cancer projects) with a group of Optus cyclists. This endurance event is bigger than anything I&#x2019;ve done before. Each year it&#x2019;s slightly different, and training typically takes a minimum of 3 months. This year, it&#x2019;s a 9-day event and we&#x2019;ll have the biggest team we&#x2019;ve ever had; 13 full tour riders, 9 stage riders, and 2 support crew, all from Optus. We start in Mackay, head to Cape Tribulation then to Cairns visiting regional communities &amp; school children along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the Tour de Cure group continued to train for various cycling events, but it became evident that it was more suited for skilled cyclists and wasn&#x2019;t inclusive for recreational riders. As such, in 2017, I was inspired to create a second cycling group that appealed to more everyday riders, some of which are taking on the challenge of Tour de Cure.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Optus&#x2019; involvement&#xA0;</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Our cycling programs are all employee-led, but Optus has been extremely supportive in many ways.<br>\nFor example, at our Macquarie Park campus, we have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Parking for over 300 bicycles</li>\n\t<li>88 showers</li>\n\t<li>Over 2,000 lockers</li>\n\t<li>On-site bicycle servicing...&amp; great coffee!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>I guess you could say we&#x2019;re pretty spoiled.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&#x2026;and that&#x2019;s why Tuesdays are epic&#xA0;</em><br>\n<br>\nEvery Tuesday, about 12-14 employees hop on their bikes and meet at our Macquarie Park campus for a 6:00 a.m. start. Talk about commitment! We head over to Lane Cove National Park. On average, most people end up cycling 35-45 km. This ride is open to all riders and abilities &#x2013; as long as you have a bike.</p>\n\n<p>One story I&#x2019;ll always remember is when an employee showed up alone, with a heavy, old bike. I could tell she was quite new to cycling so I rode with her. To get to Lane Cove National Park, it&#x2019;s quite hilly, and she walked up every hill. She was well behind the fitness ability of everyone else, but that didn&#x2019;t stop her. The following week, she came back and rode up the hills instead of walking. Plus, she brought a friend. She also had a new bike. Today, she&#x2019;s completed a few endurance rides and continues to inspire me. That&#x2019;s why I love cycling, it&#x2019;s got a great sense of community.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Safety matters</strong></h4>\n\n<p>When we go out on our rides, most employees wear the Optus cycling kits meaning we look like we&#x2019;re part of a pack. We ride together, follow the road rules, and all have insurance.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>The friendships make it all worth it</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Our programs are wholesome, we laugh a lot. I&#x2019;m in IT, I wouldn&#x2019;t normally meet many people across the&#xA0;organisation&#xA0;but I&#x2019;ve met so many people from all over the business. It&#x2019;s certainly made my career more interesting. I&#x2019;m also proud that this has given me the opportunity to role model health and fitness across Optus.</p>\n\n<p>After our rides, we come back and have a coffee together. The endorphins (and caffeine) are such a great way to start my workday.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#x2019;re interested in getting into cycling&#x2026;<br>\nHead to your local bike shop, most of them are connected to a bicycle group. That&#x2019;s probably a good place to start.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>In case you need reminding:</strong></h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It&apos;s inexpensive - avoid rising petrol costs and tolls</li>\n\t<li>It&apos;s fun and relaxing - avoid the stress of traffic congestion</li>\n\t<li>It&apos;s convenient - leave home when you want without the hassle of timetables</li>\n\t<li>It&apos;s healthy - great way to integrate exercise into your daily life</li>\n\t<li>It&apos;s good for the environment - you can do your bit to reduce congestion and CO2 emissions</li>\n\t<li>It&apos;s quick - it may actually be faster than driving or travelling by bus or train, especially for short trips.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><em>See you out there, cyclists!</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n<h4 style=\"font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\"><strong>About Optus&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.work180.com.au/clients/optus\"><img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/14235214-b0c9-43ad-bd3a-e3f0069f2291.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px; width: 300px; height: 60px;\"></a></strong></h4>\n\n<p>Optus&#x2019; focus is to create a gender balance, increasing female representation in leadership and key technical roles and continue to foster a culture where LGBTIQ+ employees are confident expressing themselves.
