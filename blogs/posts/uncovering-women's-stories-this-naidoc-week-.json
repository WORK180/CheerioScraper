This year&#x2019;s theme &#x2018;Because of Her, We Can&#x2019; celebrates the essential role that Aboriginal women have played - and continue to play - as active and significant role models at the community, local, state and national levels. For at least 65,000 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have carried our dreaming stories, songlines, languages and knowledge that have kept our culture strong and enriched us as the oldest continuing culture on the planet.</p><p>Aboriginal women&#x2019;s role in cultural, social and political survival has often been invisible, unsung or diminished.&#xA0;</p><p><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/671cd130-e33f-4f76-aa3e-161decc071ce.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/671cd130-e33f-4f76-aa3e-161decc071ce.jpeg\" style=\"font-size: 16px; float: right; margin: 10px; width: 300px; height: 200px;\"></p><p>Their achievements, their voice, their unwavering passion give us strength and have empowered past generations and paved the way for generations to come.</p><p>Our celebration kicked off with morning tea bush tucker food for morning tea and a heart-warming and very personal Acknowledgement to Country by Lee Davidson. In keeping with the theme, he spoke fondly and admirably of the role women in his family, like his older sister have played. <br></p><p>This was followed by hearing from some of our senior staff, including May Lam, Director Technology Business Management who shared her own story of how an Aboriginal family shaped her core values and believes since she was a teenager. Sherry-Ann Tomey, a Senior Officer Aboriginal Engagement also provided an insightful overview of the Diversity and Inclusion Plan initiatives and progress that RMS, as an agency, is making in attracting and retaining its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff.&#xA0;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/a87fa32f-438c-40f9-90bd-2a370b118a2d.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/a87fa32f-438c-40f9-90bd-2a370b118a2d.jpeg\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>The event closed with performances by the all-female Djaadjawan Dance group with members from four generations within their tribe.
