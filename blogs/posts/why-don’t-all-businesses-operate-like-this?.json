H<span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">aving seen how they operate over the past few weeks, I&#x2019;m more sure than ever that businesses like this are setting the standard for Australian workplaces of the future.</span><br><br><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">Let us explain.</span><br><br><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">One of the WORK180 team members reached out to FluroSat&apos;s CEO and Founder Anastasia Volkova a few months ago, but she was super busy and said she would get back to us towards the end of the year.</span><br><br><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">But then Anastasia met our Co-Founder and CEO Gemma at a KPMG event. She immediately called and said,<em>&#xA0;&#x201C;I totally get it. What do I need to change to create a more welcoming workplace for women?&#x201D;</em></span><br><br><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">We sent over a copy of WORK180&#x2019;s HR policies to use as a reference and within three business days, Anastasia had implemented every single one.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">Gender-neutral language, equal leave allowance for primary and secondary carers, zero minimum tenure required to be eligible for paid parental leave, superannuation contributions on paid parental leave, a $2k super bonus upon return to work from unpaid parental leave and a clause to ensure parents of stillborn children were not excluded.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">It made us so proud of the work they&#x2019;ve done and we want to celebrate it.</span><br><br><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">It also made us think about how appealing their company and attitude is. We&apos;re&#xA0;</span><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-c2f33919-7fff-bd86-2740-cf230390708e\">pretty sure that&#x2019;s how you build a great business.</span><br><br><strong>Learn more about &#xA0;</strong><span id=\"x_docs-internal-guid-99d1fb02-7fff-b360-c37d-9aba639f6924\"><strong><strong>FluroSat</strong></strong></span><br><span>The team at FluroSat want to change the world.
