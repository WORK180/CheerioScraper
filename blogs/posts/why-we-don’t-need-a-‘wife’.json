Her commentary is enlightening around our collective unconscious bias around who&#xA0;this work typically falls to&#xA0;in a relationship. And what default language both women and men still use when describing household&#xA0;duties, which reinforces&#xA0;gender stereotypes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am often challenged by the phrase of &#x201C;I need a wife&#x201D;. &#xA0;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a frequent reaction to our services and a sentiment expressed by those describing our services &#x2013; aaarrrgh.&#xA0; Worse still a phrase uttered primarily by women, however men stray into this area too. &#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Just last week when I was describing&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/what-women-want/support-network/professional-service-providers/concierge-collective\" target=\"_blank\">The Concierge Collective</a>&#x2018;s&#xA0;services to a very senior gentleman at a top-tier national firm, he said</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x2018;oh I&#x2019;ll tell my wife about this she&#x2019;ll love it&#x201D;. To which I replied &#x201C;don&#x2019;t you have any domestic responsibility or do you delegate everything to your wife?&#x201D; #boom</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By default, this language transfers all domestic responsibilities to wives. Sorry did we teleport back to 1950? &#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>If women are seeking gender equality why are we still talking as though the &#x2018;wife&#x2019; is the person who has the responsibility for domestic chores, personal administration management, childcare, events planning, social schedule, health care &#x2026; need I go on?</p>\n\n<p>I know I am echoing the views expressed in Annabel Crabb&#x2019;s book &#x201C;The Wife Drought&#x201D; &#xA0;where she says &#x201C;it&#x2019;s a common joke among women juggling work and family. But it&#x2019;s not actually a joke. Having a spouse who takes care of things at home is a Godsend on the domestic front. It&#x2019;s a potent economic asset on the work front. And it&#x2019;s an advantage enjoyed &#x2013; even in our modern society &#x2013; by vastly more men than women. But why is the work-and-family debate always about women? Why don&#x2019;t men get the same flexibility that women do? In our fixation on the barriers that face women on the way into the workplace, do we forget about the barriers that &#x2013; for men &#x2013; still block the exits?&#x201D;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lack of time required to take care of things at home is relevant to everyone in the household and therefore should be a shared responsibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps a change in our language to match our modern lifestyles is a tiny step forward to addressing our &#x2018;time drought&#x2019;.</p>\n\n<p>This article was originally published by <a href=\"https://femeconomy.com/why-we-dont-need-a-wife/\">Femeconomy</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/10e1de5c-9ca4-4b84-bb77-5a813798e69c.gif\" style=\"float:right; height:200px; margin:10px; width:133px\"></strong></p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<h4><strong>About The Concierge Collective</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Adele Blair is Founder and Managing Director of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.dccjobs.com/what-women-want/support-network/professional-service-providers/concierge-collective\" target=\"_blank\">The Concierge Collective</a>,&#xA0;one of Australia&#x2019;s leading concierge companies and a DCC partner.
