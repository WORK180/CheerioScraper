Kelly]</em></p><h4><br></h4><h4><strong>Why is featuring women in STEMM like this important?</strong></h4><p>I came to science late, relative to many of my peers. Due to a tumultuous start to life, my formal schooling (and housing) was broken after year 8. I didn&#x2019;t complete another year of school until I lied my way into year 12 many years later. (&#x201C;Er, yes, I have completed year 11 and all preceding years, indeed!&#x201D;) Alas, those are the years that one really gets exposed to science. I&#x2019;m still frequently ashamed of the gaps in my knowledge when I speak to biologists, chemists, and physicists.</p><p>One thing I&#x2019;ve gotten myself somewhat up to speed with is mathematics. At 30, I decided to pursue a secretly-held (and just a trifle embarrassing) lifelong dream of a career in the beautiful world of numbers. Pursuing this dream has exposed me to a polarised mix of inspiring and discouraging experiences. But what propelled me into this career, was the example provided by a couple of peers who pursued &#x2013; and succeeded in &#x2013; careers in science in their 30s, after training in fine arts and humanities.</p><p>I worked as a pianist for over 10 years, teaching and playing gigs where I could get them, until I retrained in science. Combined with my lack of high-schooling, entering a science degree was a daunting prospect. I&#x2019;d been told I wasn&#x2019;t smart enough and that I `didn&#x2019;t have the trig&#x2019;.</p><p>This is why projects, such as this, Women in Science AUSTRALIA&#x2019;s August focus on women studying STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), are so important. Not only do we need broad formal programs, such as The Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://choosemaths.org.au/\" href=\"http://choosemaths.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Choose Maths</a>&#xA0;initiative, to encourage young women into mathematics, but we need stories too. Stories told by women studying STEMM for women studying STEMM. Just as I needed stories of inspiration, I&#x2019;m sure my peers do too. Arguably, we have a duty to share our stories, to inspire any woman who has been told she can&#x2019;t science, because she is `just a girl&#x2019;.</p><p>Sadly, not all of my student peers welcomed me with open arms. I spent my undergraduate years feeling ignored by what increasingly became a cohort dominated by young, white men &#x2013; many of whom seemed to assume they could math harder and better than I.</p><p>I felt invisible. Countless times, we&#x2019;d be staring at the whiteboard, trying to solve some topological or algebraic puzzle &#x2013; and I&#x2019;d say, &#x201C;Maybe we should try&#x2026;&#x201D;, but we wouldn&#x2019;t run with my suggestion. I felt silenced, and I wondered &#x2013; I still wonder sometimes &#x2013; if I am tough enough to weather this. But I started life on the streets &#x2013; surely I, of all people, can take on a few nerdy boys! So, I persevered.</p><p>The good news is, things are changing &#x2013; and I wasn&#x2019;t completely ignored. The academic staff at my institution, La Trobe University, have been extraordinarily supportive. This year, the first of my PhD in mathematical statistics, I&#x2019;ve been given the opportunity to lecture subjects in both pure mathematics and applied statistics. I&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to work on research projects in computational biology, graph theory, abstract algebra, statistical epigenomics, and now meta-analysis. Via the lead of these academics &#x2013; and because not all of my peers suffer from unconscious bias &#x2013; I find I don&#x2019;t need to prove myself quite so much anymore.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/d29109bb-4d97-4bbd-8896-bacb249cac0c.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/d29109bb-4d97-4bbd-8896-bacb249cac0c.jpeg\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>PhD student Charles Gray: Numbers are just so, so, cool [Image: Nicole Lucchesi]</em></p><p><br></p><p>We students can help improve things for all women scientists too.
