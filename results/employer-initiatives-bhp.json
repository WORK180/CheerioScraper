The mining giant pledged to increase the number of female employees by 3% every year to deliver a 50% female workforce by 2025. CEO Andrew McKenzie promised to &#x2018;remove the unconscious bias that women have been disadvantaged by for a very long time in a male-dominated environment&#x2019;.&#xA0;&#xA0;<br></p><p><br></p><p>While women hold 16% of Australia&apos;s resources sector jobs, the percentage of women at BHP sits above the industry average at 17.6%. That&#x2019;s more than double where it was five years ago. Around 27% of the company&#x2019;s senior executives are women and 23% occupy other executive roles. At a graduate level, BHP improved itsgender balance&#xA0;intake from 34% in 2014 to 49% in 2016. By 2018,the companyhad begun paying super on unpaid parental leave and introduced athree months minimum tenure for eligibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Athalie Williams, the Company&#x2019;s Chief People Officer, says that inclusion and diversity is one of the Company&#x2019;s key strategic objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;We want to make a difference, not just for our organisation, but for society at large. it&#x2019;s about driving change at a practical, operational level. For women, that might mean having female toilets underground at mining sites or having available personal protective equipment that fits them. Or being aware of unconscious bias, such as assuming a female executive wouldn&#x2019;t take an international posting because she has young children.&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><div><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4l367rWMurU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></div>\n                            "}
