We are VC backed and have won multiple awards both in Australia and internationally. We&#x2019;ve had many exciting collaborations with companies such as CSIRO, Microsoft, Waterfront Toronto, Volkswagen, and Audi Research. We&#x2019;re a close knit team of researchers and programmers, committed to solving difficult problems surrounding the future of robotics and automation. We&#x2019;re currently working on developing a computer vision system that can understand, and generate insights on the way individuals behave in and interact with a physical environment. Our system has applications in a wide range of fields, such as supermarket automation, urban planning and autonomous vehicles. Because of this, we&#x2019;re always working on new and exciting problems and aren&#x2019;t locked in to focusing on one specific area of automation.&#xA0;<br></p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/bbdc0c15-03ea-4c0f-a86c-060e0cc8a9b1.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/bbdc0c15-03ea-4c0f-a86c-060e0cc8a9b1.jpeg\"><br><br></h2><h2><strong>Who We Are:&#xA0;</strong></h2><p>black.ai is a closely-knit team of researchers and programmers who are passionate about finding solutions to complex problems in today&#x2019;s society.
