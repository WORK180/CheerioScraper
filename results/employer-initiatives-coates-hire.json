You&#x2019;ve probably seen our orange-coloured equipment on highway upgrades and at major construction projects. That&#x2019;s us - Australia&#x2019;s largest equipment hire company, with 150 branches around Australia, employing approximately 2,000 employees and an equipment fleet worth $1.7 billion.</p><p>We&#x2019;re also a company that focuses and cares for our people. We believe that our greatest assets are our people, who ensure that our customers get the right equipment, at the right time and at the right price.</p><p>As a company who has been operating for more than 130 years we see ourselves as an employer of choice - here&#x2019;s a few reasons why.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/2a704d83-b3be-4625-ac5a-3ee751735a57.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/2a704d83-b3be-4625-ac5a-3ee751735a57.jpeg\"></p><h2><strong>Diversity</strong></h2><p>Gender equality, diversity and inclusion is something we at Coates Hire are continuously focusing on. Female participation accounts for almost 17 per cent of our workforce. We believe that diversity of thought makes a significant contribution to the success of our business, through roles as diverse as front line operations and sales, safety, leadership, corporate and IT. With a strategy focused on our people, our ongoing aim is to continuously increase female participation across all areas of our business.<br></p><h2><strong>Empowerment</strong></h2><p>We foster an inclusive and supportive environment so that all of our people can build great careers here. What does this look like in practice? A recruitment process based on merit and inclusiveness. This is showcased across all areas of our business with female Branch Managers, Customer Service Team Leaders and Senior Leaders across the business. We&#x2019;re also proud that we have a female executive on our Executive Team.<br></p><h2><strong>Paid Parental Leave</strong></h2><p>In 2015 we introduced our Parental Leave Policy. This affords primary carers 12 weeks paid leave, plus a return-to-work lump sum payment of six weeks after four weeks. More than 65 women have accessed this during their parental leave and 60 per cent of those people have returned to work to continue their careers. We also support families, our secondary-carer leave can extend to ten weeks and over 160 employees have taken this leave since April 2015.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/afa5fbfb-6e65-4a28-8cfd-0682e691d54b.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/afa5fbfb-6e65-4a28-8cfd-0682e691d54b.jpeg\"></p><h2><strong>Flexibility</strong></h2><p>Coates Hire understands that our people require a work/life balance.
