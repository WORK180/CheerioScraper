Launched in 2017, Balance is about how, when and where we work. It aims to remove barriers to flexibility (operationally and culturally), mainstream flexibility, and accelerate internal adoption rates.</p><p>Flexible work arrangements range from part-time hours to job sharing, working from home or multiple work sites, accessing a range of leave options, formal and informal time off in lieu, changing start and finish times, returning from long term leave and absences or phasing to retirement.</p><p><strong>Develop your career:</strong> We believe that everyone should have equal and easy access to training and development opportunities and fair working conditions to ensure they make the most of their talents and abilities.</p><p>Continual learning is strongly encouraged and actively supported by our leaders; it is a critical factor in ensuring we maintain our scientific and technical excellence. To support our staff, CSIRO offer a range of training opportunities, course participation and scholarships, mentoring, financial study assistance, and the opportunity to represent CSIRO at national and international conferences.<br></p><p><strong>Health, safety and environment: </strong>CSIRO&#x2019;s working environments are as diverse as the research, science and services we deliver. We ensure that our people have access to support services and work in safe, happy and comfortable conditions.
