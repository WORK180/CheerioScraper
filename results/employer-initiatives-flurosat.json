We&#x2019;re using Australia&#x2019;s best research to create user-centered software that helps farmers make informed decisions based on highly differentiated analysis. We apply the latest in machine learning and AI to fuse together multiple sources of data and create selective, accurate and actionable insights.&#xA0;</p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/cd2cc389-15b2-4cca-b398-35453097bee1.jpeg\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p>Our specialty at FluroSat is the analysis of remote sensing data (aerial and satellite imagery). We build supercharged agronomic tools to quantify the crop stress and answer the &quot;why?&quot;&#x200B; rather than &quot;where?&quot;&#x200B;. Our platform allows agronomists to access satellite/plane or upload drone data, and provides them with the information on the stress levels and nutrient content distribution around the paddock (e.g., crop health maps, N/ chlorophyll levels maps) calculated using our advanced modeling and processing tools. We go into in-depth analysis, extending beyond the visual range of light and detect the crop stress before it is visible to a human eye.&#xA0;</p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/d7007117-e761-4909-a423-7b0f97f61d20.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/d7007117-e761-4909-a423-7b0f97f61d20.jpeg\"></p><p><br></p><p>What is different about us is that we combine aerospace, agricultural and data science with state-of-the-art imagery (hyper-/multispectral imagery from drones, planes and satellites) to detect the crop stress and put it into the farm management context. Smart use of machine learning techniques and localised weather data allows our platform, FluroSense, to tailor analytics on a per-paddock level for each of the crop types separately. Our platform has already been used on three continents to manage high-value high-impact crops.
