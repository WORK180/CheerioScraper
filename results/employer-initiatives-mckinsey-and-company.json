They&#x2019;re critical to achieving our dual mission of helping our clients make substantial, lasting improvement and building a firm that attracts, develops, excites, and retains exceptional people. Our inclusive culture enriches our creativity, innovation, and problem-solving. Our teams seek out diverse perspectives that strengthen the solutions we develop with our clients and ensure all of our colleagues can be at their best. Our internal &#x201C;All In&#x201D; initiative and&#xA0;McKinsey Women&#x2019;s network&#xA0;engage all global colleagues to develop and share innovative ways of working that promote gender inclusivity, in particular. For example, we offer:<br><br></p><ul><li><strong>Best-in-class flexibility.</strong> At the start of each engagement, our teams hold a&#xA0;learning&#xA0;session&#xA0;to discuss working style preferences, set norms, align on roles, and outline personal development goals. Regular barometer surveys and team check-ins ensure teams follow these plans. In addition, we offer a variety of part-time programs, mobility options, opportunities to explore different industries and functions, extended leaves and secondments. Over 1700 consultants have worked part time at some stage of their McKinsey career.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Distinctive parental support. </strong>We offer extended leave for birth and adoptive parents, as well as a range of other health and wellness benefits and programs. Over 80% of our female partners are mothers.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>A global sponsorship initiative.</strong> Our research shows that women are more likely to succeed if they have a &#x201C;sponsor&#x201D;&#x2014;someone who will stretch them, create opportunities for them, and advocate for them. We&apos;ve launched a firm-wide sponsorship initiative to ensure that all our women and men are adequately and equitably sponsored.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Inclusive leadership training. </strong>We continually strive to build inclusive culture and mindsets. We run workshops and trainings to promote inclusive management practices and raise awareness of unconscious biases. We have changed organizational processes to reduce the opportunity for personal biases to affect decision making processes.</li></ul><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/53dbdb03-a6fa-4145-9a82-8df0ec82474a.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/53dbdb03-a6fa-4145-9a82-8df0ec82474a.jpeg\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/a744fcdb-ed01-42be-bb02-073c74c488df.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/a744fcdb-ed01-42be-bb02-073c74c488df.jpeg\"></p><p>&#x200B;</p>\n                            "}
