We&#x2019;re the only financial organisation that&#x2019;s 100% owned by Australian industry super funds, and we bring their ideals of fairness and equality to everything we do.&#xA0;<br></p><p>We&#x2019;re expanding quickly, making it the perfect time to come and grow your career with us.&#xA0;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/b38bb189-2c32-4e34-bab8-4d1d6ad40807.jpeg\">&#x200B;<br></p><h2><strong>ME is about you.</strong><br></h2><p>We know that ME is only as strong as its people.<br></p><p>So we hire thoughtfully &#x2013; and once we find the right people, we hang on to them &#x2013; by helping them step up their skills and achieve their career goals.&#xA0;<br></p><p>Our learning and development programs keep our staff focused on areas they&#x2019;re interested in, while our leadership initiatives encourage focused, forward-thinking, and most importantly, first-rate leaders.&#xA0;<br></p><p>When new jobs open up, we look to our people first. Almost half of our roles are filled from internal hiring, and there are frequent secondment opportunities available right up to the Executive level.&#xA0;<br></p><p>When our people do truly excellent work they deserve acknowledgement, and our peer-awarded recognition program &#x2013; urock - gives them real, tangible benefits for going above and beyond.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>ME is diverse.</strong><br></h2><p>Our workplace should look like our society: diverse and dynamic &#x2013; a place where people from all walks of life feel comfortable and valued.&#xA0;<br></p><p>Our Women at ME group plays a vital role, helping to promote, mentor and strengthen women&#x2019;s impact in our organisation. Our ProudlyME group supports our LGBTIQ+ staff members. We&#x2019;re also working with Talent RISE to include marginalised youth recruitment in relevant areas, giving young people a vital second chance to create a career at ME.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>ME is work/life balance.</strong><br></h2><p>Integrating work and life can be a challenge. At ME, we&#x2019;ve got plenty of programs in place to support important life events including annual leave available for purchase, flexible work arrangements that cater to your living situation, and gender-neutral parental leave (12 weeks with full pay and 26 weeks of super).&#xA0;<br></p><p>We all need a little support at times, so that&#x2019;s why we offer all employees access to a confidential counselling service offering an independent perspective if needed.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>ME is everyone.</strong></h2><p>We&#x2019;re all part of the same, big community, and we like to give back when we can. We&#x2019;ve been major sponsor the Mother&#x2019;s Day Classic for over a decade, and donated more than $1 million to the National Breast Cancer Foundation to help fight breast cancer.</p>\n                            "}
