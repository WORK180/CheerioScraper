We work with small, medium and large businesses to help them start, run and grow. For more than 150 years, we&#x2019;ve been helping our customers with their money. Today, we have more than 35,000 people serving 10 million customers at more than 800 locations in Australia, New Zealand and around the world. We know that to be Australia and New Zealand&#x2019;s most respected bank, we need to be good with money and we need to be just as good with people, too. We have built our business on understanding our customers and supporting them. We fund some of the most important infrastructures in our communities &#x2013; including schools, hospitals and roads.&#xA0;</p><div><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ZG1LDszk2U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Here are four things that we believe matter most in the recipe for gender equality in the workplace.</p><ul><li><strong>Leadership:</strong>&#xA0;Inclusion begins and ends with our leaders. At NAB, our CEO Andrew Thorburn is a WGEA Pay Equity Ambassador and a Male Champion of Change. Our Executive Leadership Team also expects all NAB leaders to demonstrate inclusive leadership, where everyone can be themselves at work.</li><li><strong>Integration:</strong>&#xA0;Gender equality can&#x2019;t be an afterthought or an add on; it must be integrated across all processes, policies and programs to ensure all bias is removed. For example, we strive to have a mix of men and women shortlisted for all management roles, and that we have males and females involved in the hiring decisions. When it comes to supporting our people with babies, we have a policy that ensures eligible primary carers can access up to three months&#x2019; paid parental leave in the first year of their child&#x2019;s life, regardless of whether they are a mum or a dad.</li><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>&#xA0;We won&#x2019;t achieve gender equality if we don&#x2019;t make flexibility a reality for all people &#x2013; both men and women. At NAB, more than 85% of our people work flexibly, including 84% of our women and 88% of our men. &#xA0;A great example of this in action is with a Head of Finance Partner role that is being shared by Allison and Karen:&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;</em></li></ul><blockquote><p><em>At NAB flexibility means different things for different people. For us it is how we do our role as a job share and the support NAB, our people and our customers provide us through working 3 days a week. This enables us to thrive in our careers, deliver on our business outcomes we need to achieve and have the time to be more involved with our children through their schools and local community sporting clubs. NAB is with us all the way and in&#xA0;</em><em>turn</em><em>&#xA0;we are engaged, focussed and absolute advocates of working with NAB!&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Targets:</strong>&#xA0;Setting ambitious gender targets and then publicly reporting on progress helps to focus people&#x2019;s minds on where we are, where we want to go, and what we need to do to get there. We&#x2019;re pleased that as of September 30 2016, at NAB, 38% of Executive Management positions were held by women, meaning we beat our target by 4 per cent.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Australia still has a long way to go before we truly treat both males and females equally, and we&#x2019;re proud to have earned the WGEA Employer of Choice for Gender Equality citation for the 9th year.</p><p><strong>At NAB, we hire the right people for the right roles, and make sure the women who work for us have the support and encouragement to reach their full potential. To do that, we&apos;ve got a whole range of great initiatives in place, including:</strong></p><h2><strong>WorkLife NAB</strong></h2><p>WorkLife NAB is an employee benefits program with a range of products and services available to you simply for being a NAB employee. The offers available are either discounted, or are preferential services not available to the general public. You&#x2019;ll get access to literally hundreds of benefits and special offers sourced to help you make the most of your money and your life. Benefits include entertainment, clothing, for the home, gift cards, shopping, technology, travel, wining and dining and more. In addition to WorkLife NAB, employees are able to join the NAB staff club to get even more genuine discounts and offers on a range of products and services.</p><p>We also offer the NAB&#x2019;s Green Your Life program, created to provide employees with sound advice and access to discounted environmentally-friendly and sustainable products and services, and tips on how to reduce your impact on the environment.</p><h2><strong>Health and Wellbeing</strong></h2><p>Our health and wellbeing strategy promotes ways to improve your health and create a sense of personal wellbeing, enabling you to reach your potential in all aspects of your work and personal life. We do this by offering a range of tools, resources, services and programs to assist in managing physical health and mental wellbeing. This includes an Employee Assistance Program, mental health program, an influenza vaccination program, and other various programs throughout the year.</p><h2><strong>Childcare Options</strong></h2><p>In recognition of the importance of childcare and to help our employees achieve work/life balance, we&#x2019;ve developed a comprehensive childcare strategy. This strategy is based around offering quality, convenient and cost effective childcare options for our employees where possible. Options will depend on workplace location. &#xA0;When it comes to supporting our people with babies, we have a policy that ensures eligible primary carers can access up to three months&#x2019; paid parental leave in the first year of their child&#x2019;s life, regardless of whether they are a mum or a dad.</p><h2><strong>Our Talent Acquisition Strategies Focus on Diversity</strong></h2><p>NAB strives to ensure that a mix of men and women are short-listed for all management roles, and that hiring decisions are made by interview panels comprised of both men and women where possible. NAB mandates female participation in job candidate pools and gender diverse interview panels, as well as ensuring all recruitment into senior management has a strong gender balance (including NAB&#x2019;s external recruitment suppliers). This extends to NAB&#x2019;s Graduate Program where we aim to have 50/50 gender balance. From January 2012, all NAB&#x2019;s preferred external recruitment suppliers need to demonstrate that they comply with NAB&#x2019;s Diversity and Inclusion Policy, have a written diversity policy/framework for their business, and undertake appropriate diversity training for their people.</p><h2><strong>Empowering Women to Win</strong></h2><p>Giving back to the community is also a key priority for NAB. Cindy Batchelor, Executive General Manager for NAB Business launched the<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://intranet.nab.com.au/AboutUs/Community/Pages/Start-Counting.aspx\" href=\"https://intranet.nab.com.au/AboutUs/Community/Pages/Start-Counting.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">&#xA0;Start Counting</a>&#xA0;program to provide the tools, knowledge and confidence to enable women to build better money and life habits. The program helps women establish what is important at each stage of their lives, and finding ways to get them there.</p><p>More than 400 women have taken part in&#xA0;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://intranet.nab.com.au/AboutUs/Community/Pages/Start-Counting.aspx\" href=\"https://intranet.nab.com.au/AboutUs/Community/Pages/Start-Counting.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Start Counting</a>, with participants reporting an 89% increase in financial literacy based on OECD variables; a 44% increase in alignment between financial decision-making and life goals; and a 29% increase in their ability to manage money through unexpected life changes.</p><h2><strong>Supporting Women in Business</strong></h2><p>NAB Board Ready Program is an internally designed and managed program, created to assist NAB&apos;s female population in gaining an understanding of boards and being a director, whether on a NAB subsidiary board, or on an external company. It provides participants with access to key educational and networking opportunities to enable them to build the skills and confidence to participate in the boardroom.</p><p>We also know that when women in business are visible it inspires change. We&#x2019;ve signed a pledge to participant in more events for women. And as business leaders, we try to ensure that events we participate in have a gender balance.</p><h2><strong>Banking and Financial Services</strong></h2><p>Because we&apos;re a bank, it makes sense that we can offer you financial products and services at more competitive rates and with reduced fees. Whether you&apos;re looking to buy your first home, a new car or plan for retirement, you&#x2019;ll get exclusive access to a range of discounted products and services.</p><p>Our Employee&apos;s Choice program offers financial benefits on loans, investments, credit cards, term deposits, insurance, financial planning and travel money to name a few.</p><h2><strong>Salary packaging &amp; Superannuation</strong></h2><p>Depending on your personal situation salary packaging can be beneficial. Non-cash benefits are deducted from your pre-tax pay which can, in some instances, result in an increase to your net disposable income. Depending on your situation you may be eligible to salary package non-cash benefits such as motor vehicle, superannuation contributions, car parking and childcare.</p><p>Super at NAB forms part of your fixed reward. All permanent and fixed term NAB and MLC employees enjoy the NAB Group Super Fund A as their default fund. This fund has been rated one of Australia&apos;s top-performing super funds.</p><h2><strong>Service recognition</strong></h2><p>In 2013, the Group changed the way service is calculated for the purpose of recognising career milestones. Any extended leave that employees take (or have taken in the past) is now included in the calculation of their years of tenure for service recognition. Many women take extended breaks from the workplace while on parental leave - this change recognises women&#x2019;s ongoing service to the Group and demonstrates our commitment to equality in the workplace.</p><p>We recognise contributions in lots of different ways. NAB Recognise is a quick and easy way to acknowledge all those great people around you who are living our values. We celebrate career milestones through our NAB Service Awards. There are also various functional recognition programs that celebrate those who have gone above and beyond in their roles.</p>\n                            "}
