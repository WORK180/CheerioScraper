We believe that inclusion is key to building strong communities and a better business.</p><p>In 2017 we won the AHRI CEO Diversity Champion award, and the Stan Grant Indigenous Employment award, for our hard work in building a diverse workforce. We were also nominated for the Dame Quentin Bryce AD CVO Gender Equity Award.</p><h3><strong>Supporting women in STEM</strong></h3><p>We believe that many factors lead to income inequality between men and women, but that a key to changing this is addressing the lack of women in STEM careers.</p><p>We think it&#x2019;s important to tackle the issue at its root, by encouraging young girls and boys to study maths and science subjects at school, and by teaching them that all jobs are gender neutral.</p><p>Our MD Chris Sutherland is the chair of CEO&#x2019;s for Gender Equity, and encouraging women into STEM careers is a particular passion of his.</p><h3 style=\"font-family: Lato, sans-serif; text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/13fc94e9-f228-491c-a2e8-8f0c10ca4aa5.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/13fc94e9-f228-491c-a2e8-8f0c10ca4aa5.jpeg\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px; font-weight: 300; text-align: center; width: 80%;\"></h3><h3><strong>Gender Balance</strong></h3><p>We&#x2019;re also working hard on achieving gender balance in our workplace, and getting women into leadership and trades roles. Our team is currently 51% women, not including trades, and 31% women overall across the business.</p><p>We&#x2019;re big believers in supporting women striving for leadership roles, because the skills it takes to lead aren&#x2019;t gender specific, and we want all our people to know that we support their growth and development.</p><p>We&#x2019;re not keen on stereotypes, so we work to get women into roles traditionally seen as being masculine, because gender doesn&#x2019;t determine ability.</p><p>We also work closely with our customers on their diversity, inclusion and equality goals.</p><div><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlmtGpmgkMM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h3><strong>Flexibility</strong></h3><p>We have a fantastic team at Programmed, but we understand that they have a life outside of work, which is why we&#x2019;re happy to be flexible.</p><p>We know that flexibility won&#x2019;t be suited to every role, but we&#x2019;re happy to accommodate it when it is.
