We strive to foster an environment that allows and encourages all team members to challenge the status quo. When planning business growth and strategizing around new developments &#x2013; improving patient outcomes forms the basis of all fundamental business decisions.&#xA0;<br><br>We also believe in, and actively promote a healthy work-life balance. Whilst we are a passionate group who enjoy working hard, and actively encourage our team members to stretch their capabilities - we also recognise that everyone has their own life to lead outside of work. We believe good health and wellbeing is everyone&#x2019;s right, and that everyone needs space and time for family, friends and your own personal time. Where required our individualised flexible work place practices, allow our team members to tailor a framework that allows our them to operate at their peak potential in and out of the work environment.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-cke-saved-src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/c4c0bf25-4131-4b7b-bda5-58d259b58cae.jpeg\" src=\"https://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/c4c0bf25-4131-4b7b-bda5-58d259b58cae.jpeg\"></p>\n                            "}
