That sense of being stretched to be better is right at home here.</p><h2>Diverse opportunities to grow, back yourself and achieve</h2><p>We take on exciting work across a breadth of industries and a depth of services as we connect clients with experts in a wide range of fields.</p><p>At any stage in your career, UGL provides scope to work with, and learn from, the best.

In 2018, after a gender pay equity audit, we reset pay parity across the business and put our recruiters and hiring managers through unconscious bias training. By regularly checking on pay equity across the HR lifecycle, we reduced our gender pay gap to less than 2% across 9 of our 14 job families.</p><h5><em>&#x201C;I have an acute focus on gender pay equity because it&#x2019;s a barometer for other inequitable people practices. In my experience, when you get this right, it creates a positive ripple effect across the organisation. UGL measures pay equity at multiple points in the HR lifecycle, not just at hiring, but in every salary, performance, bonus and promotion review. That way, we continually correct tiny like-for-like pay gaps before they can get any wider.&#x201D;</em></h5><h5 align=\"right\"><strong>Sarah Elliott, GM Remuneration &amp; Org Development</strong></h5><p><br></p><h2>Xplore for Success</h2><p>UGL and Xplore have partnered since 2016 to deliver annual development programs.
